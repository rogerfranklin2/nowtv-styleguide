## Motiviation
Create a set of basic styles for static sites and the respective app specific toolkits to rely upon (e.g. React)

## Issues

- Link colour (grey) is just too light
- Disabled text links are still actionable
- Missing :focus styling for buttons
- Input placeholder will not work on IE9 and below or Opera Mini
- No scrollbar on multiline single select, could be confusing for users
